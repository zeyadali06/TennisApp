HomeFeature:
    Data:
        DataSource:
            AIModelServices: contains getPrediction function to send request to the ai model
            WeatherApiServices: contains getForecastWeather and getCurrentWeather functions to get weather from the api
        
        Mappers:
            AIModelMapper: contains fromCurrentWeatherModel and fromForecastWeatherModel functions that convert models to AIModelEntity
            WeatherMapper: contains fromCurrentWeatherModel and fromForecastWeatherModel functions that convert models to WeatherEntity
        
        Models:
            CurrentWeatherModel: model that contains all data returned from weatherapi in current section
            ForecastWeatherModel: model that contains all data returned from weatherapi in forecast section

        RepoImplementation:
            AIModelRepoImpl: implements getPrediction function to predict if the user can go to play tennis or not
            WeatherRepoImpl: implements WeatherRepo's two functions getCurrentWeather that get the weather of the current day
                             and getForecastWeather to get the weather of other days
    
    Domain:
        Entities:
            AIModelEntity: model that contains attributes used in the UI
            WeatherEntity: model that contains attributes used in the UI
        
        RepoInterface:
            AIModelRepo: abstract class that contains getPrediction function
            WeatherRepo: abstract class that contains getCurrentWeather and getForecastWeather functions
        
        UseCases:
            CurrentDayWeatherUseCase: uses getCurrentWeather from WeatherRepo to get the weather of the current day
            AnotherDayWeatherUseCase: uses getForecastWeather from WeatherRepo to get the weather of other days
            GetPredictionUseCase: uses getCurrentWeather from WeatherRepo to get the weather statistics and then uses 
                                  getPrediction from AIModelRepo to send request to the model and get prediction

    Presentation:
        Controllers:
            HomeViewCubit: contains getCurrentWeather, getForecastWeather and getPrediction functions and 6 states
                           (HomeViewInitial, HomeViewLoading, HomeViewSuccess, HomeViewFailed, GetPredictionSuccess, GetPredictionFailed)

        Views:
